## MIDOG 2025 Track 2 Binary Classification

This repository contains the full pipeline submitted to the MICCAI MIDOG 2025 Challenge - Track 2.

The code, model evaluations, and all files required to reproduce the results are provided here. 

### Data sets
We used the AmiBr dataset available at: 

    https://github.com/DeepMicroscopy/AMi-Br/tree/main/patches

    Bertram, C.A. et al. (2025). Histologic Dataset of Normal and Atypical Mitotic Figures on Human Breast Cancer (AMi-Br). In: Palm, C., et al. Bildverarbeitung f√ºr die Medizin 2025. BVM 2025. Informatik aktuell. Springer Vieweg, Wiesbaden.

We added the offical dataset from the MIDOG Challenge, without the overlap with Amibr. This dataset is publically available:

    Weiss, V., et al. A Dataset of Atypical Vs Normal Mitoses Classification for MIDOG - 2025. Zenodo, 17 July 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16044804.

Lastly, we used the Octopath dataset also publically available:

    Shen, Z., et al. Omg-octo Atypical: A Refinement of the Original Omg-octo Database to Incorporate Atypical Mitoses. Zenodo, 18 July 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16107743.


### Train and test split
All three datasets were merged into one cvs with the ['merge_datasets.py'](./merge_datasets.py). Here the duplicated data from Amibr got removed from Midog. 
The merged dataset was then split at **patient level** into an 80/20 train/test split using [`pat_split.py`](./pat_split.py).
The used split is provided in the pat_split folder.

### Pipeline
For internal testing, the [`pipeline.py`](./pipeline.py) script was used.  
For the official MIDOG Challenge submission, training was performed without an internal test set using [`pipeline_no_test.py`](./pipeline_no_test.py).
